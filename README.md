## 🧭 Introduction

This repository contains six practical laboratory projects focused on the theory and implementation of formal languages, grammars, and automata. Each lab builds upon foundational concepts in automata theory and compiler construction, providing hands-on experience through C# implementations. The topics range from grammar conversions and lexical analysis to abstract syntax tree (AST) generation and DSL design.

## 🧪 Lab Overview

| Lab # | Title & Link | Description |
|------:|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | [🚀 Grammar to Finite Automaton Conversion](https://github.com/AlexandruRudoi/LFA_Labs/blob/Lab_1/REPORT.md) | Implements a system that converts right-linear grammars into equivalent finite automata and validates strings against the language. |
| 2 | [🔁 NDFA to DFA Conversion & Grammar Classification](https://github.com/AlexandruRudoi/LFA_Labs/blob/Lab_2/REPORT.md) | Converts non-deterministic finite automata (NDFA) into DFA and classifies grammars according to the Chomsky hierarchy. |
| 3 | [🧩 AION Lexer and Tokenizer System](https://github.com/AlexandruRudoi/LFA_Labs/blob/Lab_3/REPORT.md) | Develops a lexer for the AION DSL, handling keywords, durations, symbols, and complex date-time constructs. |
| 4 | [🧪 Regex String Generator](https://github.com/AlexandruRudoi/LFA_Labs/blob/Lab_4/REPORT.md) | Parses regular expressions and generates matching strings, with support for tracing how each output was constructed. |
| 5 | [🔧 Chomsky Normal Form Converter](https://github.com/AlexandruRudoi/LFA_Labs/blob/Lab_5/REPORT.md) | Transforms context-free grammars (CFGs) into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) and exports the structure as a Graphviz visualization. |
| 6 | [🌳 Parser & Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generator](https://github.com/AlexandruRudoi/LFA_Labs/blob/Lab_6/REPORT.md) | Constructs a recursive-descent parser and generates an AST for the AION DSL, enabling structured calendar event representation. |

## ✅ Conclusion

Throughout these six labs, I gained extensive knowledge in working with formal grammars, finite automata, regular expressions, and compiler front-end components. Starting from grammar-to-automaton transformations, the journey progressed toward developing a custom language parser complete with tokenization, AST construction, and visualizations. These projects not only strengthened my theoretical understanding but also honed my skills in designing modular, scalable tools for language processing using C# and .NET.
